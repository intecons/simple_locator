Simple Locator is a minimal helper script for the navigator.geolocation functions.

It's main feature is the usage of watchLocation to continuously update the current location with the main purpose of getting accurate coordinates. The accuracy can be controlled with the threshold option.

In addition to that, it supports reverse geocoding - just include the google maps api v3 and add the option google_geocoding : true

Usage is pretty simple:

simple_locator({
	threshold: 25, // 25 meter minimum accuracy
	running_callback: function(loc, loc_name) { }, // called every time the position or accuracy changes
	finished_callback: function(loc, loc_name) { } // called as soon as accuracy < threshold
});


Extensions and bugfixes are very much appreciated!
